## [Unreleased]

## [4.1.0] - 2021-01-03

### Added

- Added `scroller` prop for limiting scroll distance when `mode` is set to `bottom`, in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/73)
- Added `initialScrollBehavior` prop for first scroll behavior. When set to `"auto"` (discrete scrolling), it will jump to end on initialization. in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/73)
- Added `debug` prop for dumping debug log to console, in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/73)
- Improved performance by separating `StateContext` into 2 tiers, in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/73)

### Fixed

- Emptying container should regain stickiness, in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/73)

## [4.0.0] - 2020-09-01

### Added

- Support `nonce` prop for [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy), in PR [#62](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/62), PR [#63](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/63) and PR [#64](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/64)

### Changed

- Moved from `glamor@2.20.40` to `create-emotion@10.0.27`, in PR [#62](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/62)

## [3.0.0] - 2020-06-21

### Breaking changes

- `scrollToBottom`/`scrollToEnd`/`scrollToStart`/`scrollToTop` now accept an option `{ behavior: 'auto' | 'smooth' }`
   - Without the option, it is by default to artificial smooth scrolling (`smooth`), to keep existing behavior
   - This behavior may change in the future, by defaulting to discrete scrolling (`auto`), to better align with HTML `DOMElement.scrollIntoView` standard
   - During the transition, please always pass `{ behavior: 'smooth' }` to keep existing behavior

### Changed

- Bump dependencies, in PR [#50](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/50)

### Added

- Added version number to `<meta name="react-scroll-to-bottom:version">` for diagnostic purpose, in PR [#51](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/51)
- Added `useAnimatingToEnd` getter to indicate if it is animating towards to the end, in PR [#49](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/49)
   - The existing `useAnimating` getter only indicate if it is animating to any scroll positions
- Added `scrollTo` function to scroll to a specific `scrollTop` value, this is similar to `DOMElement.scrollIntoView()`, in PR [#49](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/49)
   - The signature is `scrollTo(scrollTop: number, options: { behavior: 'auto' | 'smooth' })`
   - Pass `{ behavior: 'smooth' }` for synthetic smooth scrolling
- Added `useObserveScrollTop` hook to observe scroll event, in PR [#49](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/49)
   - This effect function will be called rapidly on scroll, please avoid expensive code such as calling setter of `useState` and any code that would cause re-render

### Fixed

- `Composer`: fix [#22](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issue/22), synthetic `scroll` events crafted by Chrome should not cause stickiness to lose, in PR [#23](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issue/23)

## [1.3.1] - 2019-02-13

### Changed

- `Composer`: fix [#13](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issue/13), user scrolling in Firefox may have the scroll position locked occasionally, in PR [#12](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/12)
- `SpineTo`: fix [#10](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issue/10), set stopping threshold from `0.5` to `1.5`, in PR [#14](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/pull/14)

## [1.3.0] - 2019-01-21

### Changed

- Playground: bumped to `react@16.6.0`, `react-dom@16.6.0`, and `react-scripts@2.1.6`
- `*`: Update algorithm, instead of using `componentDidUpdate`, we now use `setInterval` to check if the panel is sticky or not, this help to track content update that happen outside of React lifecycle, for example, `HTMLImageElement.onload` event
- `Composer`: `scrollTo()` now accepts `"100%"` instead of `"bottom"`

### Removed

- Removed `threshold` props because the algorithm is now more robust

## [1.2.0] - 2018-10-28

### Added

- `AutoHideFollowButton`: will now hide when it start animating scroll position
- `BasicScrollToBottom`: will now pass `debounce` and `threshold` to `Composer`, fix [#2](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issues/2)
- `Composer`: `debounce` prop to control debouncing on `onScroll` event, default to `17`
- `FunctionContext`: `scrollTo` now support `"bottom"`, in addition to a `number`, fix [#1](https://github.com/compulim/react-scroll-to-bottom/issues/1)
   - This will help when animating scroll position while new content was added to the panel
- `FunctionContext`: `scrollToStart` function to scroll to the start, depends on `mode`
- `StateContext`: `animating` returns `true` if the scroll position is being animated
- `StateContext`: `atStart` indicates if the scroll position is at the start or not, depend on `mode`

### Changed

- Performance improvements
   - `Context` is now separated into `FunctionContext`, `InternalContext` and `StateContext` for better performance and reduce exposure
      - `FunctionContext` is static and only hold functions for manipulating the panel
      - `InternalContext` is static and for internal use (to overcome shortcomings of `React.createRef`)
      - `StateContext` is dynamic and change when scroll position change
   - `StateContext` will now only update if there are any meaningful changes
- Added `displayName` to context
- [`lerna`](https://npmjs.com/package/lerna) bumped from `2.11.0` to `3.4.3`

## [1.1.0] - 2018-06-22
